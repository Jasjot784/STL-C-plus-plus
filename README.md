# STL(Standard Template Library) C++
My this github repository will be based on the 10 lectures of Stephan-T-Lavavej(https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Standard-Template-Library-STL- ) and I will be sharing the code used by him throughout his lectures on behalf of my undersatnding. Please feel free to drop over any suggestion.
